# Kaggle Titanic

This repo is for my experiementation with machine learning using the introductory Kaggle problem [http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted](Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster).

The initial code was F# as provided by Phil Trelford at the Cambridge DDD session run in February 2012.  I then decided to try implementing a similar standard of program in Clojure to see how the langauges differ.
